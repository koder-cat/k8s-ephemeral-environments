# Corporate Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your organization's interest in contributing to K8s Ephemeral Environments ("Project"). This Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by corporate contributors to the Project.

## Purpose

This Agreement covers contributions made by employees or contractors of a company or organization ("Corporation"). It supplements the Individual CLA by providing explicit authorization from the Corporation.

## Agreement

The Corporation agrees to the following terms:

### 1. Definitions

**"Corporation"** means the company or organization signing this Agreement.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including modifications or additions to existing work, submitted by any employee, contractor, or authorized representative of the Corporation.

**"Authorized Contributors"** means employees, contractors, or agents of the Corporation who are authorized to make Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.

### 2. Grant of Rights

#### 2.1 Copyright License

The Corporation grants to Genes Luna and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce Contributions
- Prepare derivative works of Contributions
- Publicly display and perform Contributions
- Sublicense and distribute Contributions and derivative works

This includes the right to license Contributions under any license, including proprietary licenses.

#### 2.2 Patent License

The Corporation grants to Genes Luna and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Contributions.

This license applies only to patent claims licensable by the Corporation that are necessarily infringed by Contributions alone or by combination with the Project.

### 3. Authorized Contributors

The Corporation is responsible for:

- Identifying individuals authorized to make Contributions on its behalf
- Ensuring Authorized Contributors are aware of and comply with this Agreement
- Notifying the Project when individuals should be added or removed from the authorized list

### 4. Representations

The Corporation represents that:

#### 4.1 Authorization

The Corporation has the authority to enter into this Agreement and grant the licenses described herein.

#### 4.2 Intellectual Property Rights

For each Contribution made by an Authorized Contributor:
- The Corporation owns or has sufficient rights to the intellectual property in the Contribution
- The Contribution does not violate any third-party intellectual property rights
- Any third-party content in the Contribution is properly identified

#### 4.3 Employee Agreements

The Corporation has appropriate agreements with its employees and contractors to ensure it can grant the rights described in this Agreement.

### 5. Individual CLAs

Authorized Contributors are still required to sign the Individual CLA. The Corporate CLA provides the organizational authorization; the Individual CLA documents the individual's agreement to the terms.

### 6. Disclaimer

Contributions are provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind. The Corporation is not obligated to provide support for Contributions.

### 7. Term and Termination

This Agreement remains in effect until terminated. Either party may terminate by providing written notice to the other. Termination does not affect:
- Rights granted for Contributions made before termination
