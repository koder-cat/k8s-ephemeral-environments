# Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to K8s Ephemeral Environments ("Project"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to the Project.

## Why We Need a CLA

This Project uses a dual licensing model (AGPL-3.0 and Commercial). To maintain this model and protect both contributors and users, we need clear rights to all contributions. This CLA:

- Ensures we can continue offering both open source and commercial licenses
- Protects you by documenting your rights
- Protects the Project and its users

## Agreement

By signing this Agreement, you accept and agree to the following terms:

### 1. Definitions

**"You"** means the individual signing this Agreement.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing work, that you submit to the Project.

**"Submit"** means any form of communication sent to the Project, including but not limited to pull requests, issues, commits, or messages on GitHub.

### 2. Grant of Rights

#### 2.1 Copyright License

You grant to Genes Luna and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce your Contributions
- Prepare derivative works of your Contributions
- Publicly display and perform your Contributions
- Sublicense and distribute your Contributions and derivative works

This includes the right to license Contributions under any license, including proprietary licenses.

#### 2.2 Patent License

You grant to Genes Luna and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution.

This license applies only to patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your Contribution with the Project.

### 3. Your Rights

You retain all rights to your Contributions. This Agreement does not transfer ownership of your Contributions; it only grants the licenses described above.

You are free to use your Contributions for any other purpose, including contributing them to other projects.

### 4. Representations

You represent that:

#### 4.1 Original Work

Each Contribution is your original creation, or you have the right to submit it under this Agreement.

#### 4.2 Legal Capacity

You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you represent that:
- You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, OR
- Your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions, OR
- Your employer has signed a Corporate CLA

#### 4.3 Third-Party Content

If your Contribution includes any material that is not your original creation, you have identified it with its source and any license or other restriction.

### 5. Support and Warranty Disclaimer

You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions unless you choose to do so. Contributions are provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind.

### 6. Notification

You agree to notify the Project if you become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make your representations inaccurate.
